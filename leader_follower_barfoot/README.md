# Leader Follower Formations (Geometric Approach)

Implementation of leader-follower trajectory planning based on the paper [Motion planning for formations of mobile robots](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921889003001854) (Barfoot 2004).

## To Use
Run `run_static.py` to see the example of unchanging offsets over time.

Run `run_dynamic.py` to see the example of changing offsets over time.

Edit `trajectory.py` and `params.py` to create a custom "leader" trajectory.
