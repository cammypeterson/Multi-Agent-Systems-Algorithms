# Packages
The following packages are needed to run the code:
```
numpy
Pillow
matplotlib
scipy
```

They can be installed using the following commands:
```
pip install numpy
pip install Pillow
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
```

# Running the code
Each script in the main directory runs one of three methods: 
  - Naive rendezvous (does not guarantee connectedness)
  - Rendezvous
  - Formation control

These methods are each run, respectively, in the following scripts:
- naive_rendezvous_example.py
- rendezvous_example.py
- formation_control_example.py

The `Classes/` directory contains the classes used to simulate the system and agent connections.

See specific python files for more information on the code.

See the included powerpoint for information on the theory.
